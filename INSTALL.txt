--------------------------------------


ENVIRONMENT
--------------------------------
1. Install Apache 2.2.x
2. Download PHP 5.3.x or later
3. Setup you apache with PHP	
4. Install mysql 5.1.x or later


APPLICATION
--------------------------------
1. Create a new folder in your webserver document root called "limbo".

2. Paste the contents of the "limbo" folder in the thesis CD into the newly created folder.

3. Create an empty mysql database called "limbo"

	> mysql -u<username> -p<password>
	> create database limbo;
	> exit;
	
4. Locate the limbo-generate.sql in /document/root/limbo i.e. the folder you created in step 1

5. Run the following command in a terminal

	>mysql -u<username> -p<password> limbo < /path/to/limbo/root/limbo-generate.sql
	
6. Go to the application root folder (the folder you created in step 1) and edit the following files

	a. /path/to/limbo/configuration/config.php

	$config = array(
	    "root" => "/limbo",
	    "assets" => "/limbo/public",
		"js" => "/limbo/public/scripts/"
	);
	?>
	
	Make sure that "root" points to the correct application root. If you named the folder in step-1 as "limbo" then the above setup is correct.
	
	b. Edit /path/to/limbo/configuration/limbo.php
	
	<?php
	$local = array(
	    "db" => array(
	        "user" => "root",
	        "password" => "password",
	        "database" => "limbo"
	    )
	);
	?>
	
	Make sure you supply correct username and password for mysql access. If you named the database as "limbo" then you do not need to change the "database" part.
	
7.	Open a browser and point to http://localhost/limbo/

	The application should now start.
